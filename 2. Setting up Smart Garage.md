# Software setup
1. Download all of the required software
NodeMCU: NodeMCU has the direct link attached  
Tasmota: Download the tasmota.bin file  
Esp8266 drivers: Extract the zipped folder, and then run the CP210xVCPInstaller_x86.exe and follow the prompts
2. Plug the ESP8266 into your computer
Troubleshooting: If you are unable to see your device in device manager (right click on the start button and select 'device manager'), you may have plugged in the device with a cable that is either, faulty or doesnt have the data line attached. To work around this, simply try with another cable.
If you can see your device, however has a yellow icon on it, you will need to install the drivers again, or confirm that you have installed the correct drivers.
