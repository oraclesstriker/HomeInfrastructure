# Software setup
1. Download all of the required software
NodeMCU: NodeMCU has the direct link attached  
Tasmota: Download the tasmota.bin file  
Esp8266 drivers: Extract the zipped folder, and then run the CP210xVCPInstaller_x86.exe and follow the prompts
2. Plug the ESP8266 into your computer and confirm what PORT (COM #) its connected to.
You can do this by right clicking on the start button and select 'device manager'. You can then view what its connected too under the "Ports (COM & LPT)" tab
Troubleshooting issues: If you are unable to see your device in device manager, you may have plugged in the device with a cable that is either, a, faulty or, b, doesnt have the data line attached. To work around this, simply try with another cable.  
If you can see your device, however has a yellow icon on it, you will need to install the drivers again, or confirm that you have installed the correct drivers.  
3. Open NodeMCU Flasher
4. Fill in the following,
- Serial Port: COM number relating to your device in device manager
- NodeMCU Firmware: This is the location of your tasmota.bin file
- Baud rate: This should be stated on the back of your ESP8266, however I increase the baud rate from 9600 to 74880
- Flash mode: Select Dual I/O (DIO)
- Erase Flash: Select 'yes, wipes all data'
5. Click 'Flash NodeMCU'
6. Upon confirmation it will state 'Firmware successfully flashed' in the window.  
7. Unplug the ESP8266 and wire it (as per the wire diagram).  
8. Click on the wifi icon and connect to your tasmota device.  
9. Once connected a new webpage will open and you will be met with the tasmota wifi connection page.
10. Connect to your home wifi (or if you're fancy like the oracle, connect to your IoT Network).  
11. The ESP8266 will disconnect and reconnect to your wifi. Connect back to your Wifi.  
12. From the Tasmota Home page, click 'Configuration'.  
13. click 'Configure MQTT'.  
14. Enter the following details,  
- Raspberry Pi Address 
- MQTT Broker username
- MQTT Broker password
- MQTT Topic: A topic should correlate to the overall function of your device.
15. Click save and wait for the reboot.  
Note: You can confirm if this was successful or not by clicking on the 'Console' button on the homescreen, and viewing the logs.
16. Open a webpage to your home assistant and click refresh, you should now see a 'tasmota' tile on your Home Assistant Integrations page (Home Assistant>Settings>Devices & Services)
17. On the tasmota tile, click Configure and then submit.  
18. State the Area this is going to be used in (Garage) and click Finish.  
Home Assistant can now fully communicate to your ESP8266
19. Navigate back to your ESP8266 page. Select 'Configure' then 'Configure Module'
20. Change the module type from 'Sonoff Basic (1)' to 'Generic (18)'
21. Click Save and wait for the reboot. Upon reboot, navigate back to the 'Configure Module' page.
22. Under 'D1 GPIO5' Select 'Relay' and Under 'D5 GPIO14' Select 'Switch'. Click Save and wait for reboot.  
23. From the tasmota homepage, select 'Console'.  
24. Input the following commands,
- SwitchTopic Garagedoor
- switchmode1 1
- switchretain on
- setoption19 1
25. Navigate back to Home Assistant and click on 'Overview' in the left blade.
You will now see a Sensor and 2 Switches. 
26. Navigate to your Devices & Services page (Home Assistant > Settings > Devices & Services)
27. Under the MQTT Tile, click '1 Device'
28. Click the '+' icon in the 'Automations' tile  
29. Under "Only do something if..." click 'Tasmota is on'
30. Name the Automation "Fix Garage Door Relay"
31. Set Duration to '03 Seconds'
32. Click 'Add Action', Select the following,
- Action Type: Device
