# Initialising the Raspberry Pi OS
Prerequisites:  
Download Raspberry Pi Imager [Link](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/imager/imager_latest.exe)  

1. Connect your SD card to your device

6. Under Storage, click 'Choose Storage'
7. Select your SD Card
8. Click the Gear icon
9. Set the following values,  
- Set hostname: <This will be the name of your Pi>
- Enable SSH
- Set Username and Password: <We want to make this secure and definitely NOT a default username and STRONG Password to store in KeePassXC>
- Configure Wireless LAN: <If you are going to have this connected to Wifi, enable this, if not, keep this unchecked>
- Set Locale: <Select your timezone and leave the keyboard setup to US>
10. Click save
11. Click write
12. Wait for completion and then plug the SD Card into your Pi.
13. Power up your Pi and if you are connected it to Ethernet, plug in your ethernet cable.  
14. Open up Powershell (standard user, doesn't need to be as an Administrator)
15. input the command,
ssh <username>@hostname
example: ssh oraclesstriker@homepi
Note: i havent included the .local in the hostname. If you are having issues try to log in with the IP Address instead of the hostname (You can find this in your router under connected clients)
example: ssh oraclesstriker@192.168.1.175
16. If you have been able to reach the Pi, you will be met with the message 
"The authenticity of host 'homepi (192.168.1.175)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:0bqmV87uTkJVVQ6UQzcPrDRF+UoFIMceK9nY9UfJgi4.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?"
Type "yes"
17. You will be prompted to input the password
If successful, your terminal should now show the bash commands and the left side will turn green.

# Setting up docker and our containers
Oraclesstriker has done all the hard work for you.
Run the docker script
Run the mqtt broker script - you will need to input some stuff here.
Run the home assistant script
Boom, you're done.

# Setting up Home assistant
1. Open a web browser and enter the IP address the port number 8123
example: 192.168.1.175:8123
Note: Have KeePassXC running in the background as youll need to store your credentials.
2. Enter your name and password
Store this immediately in KeePassXC
3. Enter the name of your home and click detect (this will prefill all your settings)
